# Docker and go challenge

This was my first challenge with Docker and Go. The challenge was to create a docker image that would print "Full Cycle Rocks!" to the console, and it needed to have a size of 2MB maximum.

## Build

```bash
  docker build -t <user>/<name> .
```

## Run

```bash
  docker run --rm <user>/<name> .
```

## Pull from Docker Hub

```bash
  docker pull aruadecarvalho/desafio-docker-go .
```
